### 1. **Projects & Responsibilities**

- **MT-Player Optimizations**: Took ownership of optimizing the loading time of the MS-viewer, a critical component for content playback. This project was an excellent onboarding opportunity to familiarize myself with Mindtickle's codebase and coding practices. I contributed to improving performance, reducing latency, and enhancing the user experience.
    
    - [PR Link](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/mt-content-ui/-/merge_requests/9574)
- **PS-PDF Migration**: Contributed to the evaluation and integration of PDF players for viewing and conversion purposes. Assessed multiple tools against our specific requirements and implemented the solution with robust coding practices and unit testing. Despite production challenges due to node version compatibility, the project was a learning experience in dependency management and compatibility assessments.
    
    - [PR Link 1](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/design-library/-/merge_requests/2123)
- **Content Center Performance Optimization**: Improved the Page Load Time (PLT) by implementing a caching mechanism for remote entries on Cloudfront. This optimization significantly enhanced user experience and reduced loading times for frequently accessed components.
    
    - [JIRA Ticket](https://mindtickle.atlassian.net/browse/CN-12113?focusedCommentId=447267)
- **Partial Sync Status**: Took full ownership of Frontend for this complex feature, involving the development of both frontend and GraphQL components. Encompassed multiple repositories, including mt-content-ui, integrations-ui, content-gql-schema, and integration-gql. I ensured seamless integration and on-time delivery by collaborating across teams and addressing ambiguous requirements.
    
    - mt-content-ui [PR](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/mt-content-ui/-/merge_requests/9646)
    - integrations-ui [PR](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/integrations-ui/-/merge_requests/998)
    - Content GraphQL PRs: [PR 1](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/content-gql-schema/-/merge_requests/3244), [PR 2](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/content-gql-schema/-/merge_requests/3241),
    - Integration GQL [PR 1](https://gitlab.com/mindtickle/integration-gql/-/merge_requests/93)
- **Production Issues**: Resolved critical production issues, such as:
    - File or folder is accessed after deletion.

### 3. **Challenges Overcome**

- **Different Coding Practices in Codebases:** Working across multiple repositories such as `mt-content-ui`, `integrations-ui`, `integration-gql` and `content-gql-schema` exposed me to varying coding standards and practices. Adapting to these differences while ensuring consistent implementation and adhering to best practices was a significant challenge. I overcame this by proactively understanding the existing codebases and collaborating with other team members.

- **Complex Integrations**: The Partial Sync Status project required handling multiple dependencies and repositories. I proactively addressed integration challenges by ensuring clear communication and detailed planning across teams.

- **Production Debugging**: Debugging orphan folder handling and unauthorized GraphQL errors and Snag errors involved tracing issues across multiple layers of the stack. These experiences enhanced my debugging skills and deepened my understanding of Mindtickleâ€™s architecture.
